My interests broadly lie in the fields of machine learning, natural language processing and computer vision. 
[Here](/research/courses/) is a list of all the courses I have taken, both during graduate and undergraduate studies.

- Overcoming Language Variation in POS Tagging using Social Attention (Ongoing)
	- Working on building a novel attention-based neural network model that exploits social networks to make
POS tagging more robust to social language variation.

- Modeling Compositionality in Visual Question Answering VQA (Ongoing)
	- Exploring Relational and Dynamic Memory Networks to build VQA models that are more visually grounded
and have more reasoning ability.

- Deep Learning Models for Text Summarization (Summer 2017)
	- SDE Intern, Amazon AI, Seattle, USA
	- Developed a recurrent neural network based hierarchical sequence-to-sequence model that uses attention
and pointer networks for both extractive and abstractive summarization in mxnet.

- Encoding constraints into Community Detection algorithms (2015 - 2016)
	- Undergraduate Thesis, IIT Guwahati, India
	- Developed a constrained spectral community detection algorithm that can incorporate domain specific
degree-of-belief constraints about the clustering structure of the network to obtain better clusters



###### Projects

- Text to Image Synthesis using GANs
	- Investigated various models using generative adversarial networks GANs to generate a sequence of images
based on the context extracted from a textual description.

- Scene Recognition with Deep Learning
	- Implemented AlexNet and VGG deep learning neural networks for the task of Instance Scene Recognition
on the 15 class scene dataset. Achieved upto 90% accuracy.

- Sentiment Analysis and Summarization of Online Reviews
	- Designed and built a machine learning model to extract the key positive and negative sentiments from the
IMDB reviews with respect to various aspects and provide a brief summary to the users.

- Hidden Markov model for Speech Recognition
	- Built an isolated word recognition system using a Hidden Markov Model for each word and identifying the
word based on the highest model likelihood.

- Initially Labeled Learning in Non-Stationary Environments
	- Developed an algorithm using an under-sampling approach combined with an ensemble approach to improve
the model’s performance in classification of non-stationary data.

- Unsupervised Framework to find spoken terms
	- Developed an indexing module by using various clustering algorithms including the BIRCH clustering algorithm to enable searching a spoken query within large spoken audio database.

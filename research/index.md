My interests broadly lie in the fields of machine learning, natural language processing and computer vision. 
[Here](/research/courses/) is a list of all the courses I have taken, both during graduate and undergraduate studies.  

- **Overcoming Language Variation in POS Tagging using Social Attention** (Ongoing)
	- Working on building a novel attention-based neural network model that exploits social networks to make
POS tagging more robust to social language variation.        
            


- **Modeling Compositionality in Visual Question Answering VQA** (Ongoing)
	- Exploring Relational and Dynamic Memory Networks to build VQA models that are more visually grounded
and have more reasoning ability.      
           


- **Deep Learning Models for Text Summarization** (Summer 2017)
	- SDE Intern, Amazon AI, Seattle, USA
	- Developed a recurrent neural network based hierarchical sequence-to-sequence model that uses attention
and pointer networks for both extractive and abstractive summarization in mxnet.      
             


- **Encoding constraints into Community Detection algorithms** (2015 - 2016)
	- Undergraduate Thesis, IIT Guwahati, India
	- Developed a constrained spectral community detection algorithm that can incorporate domain specific
degree-of-belief constraints about the clustering structure of the network to obtain better clusters.     
             




### Projects

- **Text to Image Synthesis using GANs**
	- Investigated various models using generative adversarial networks GANs to generate a sequence of images
based on the context extracted from a textual description.      
           


- **Scene Recognition with Deep Learning**
	- Implemented AlexNet and VGG deep learning neural networks for the task of Instance Scene Recognition
on the 15 class scene dataset. Achieved upto 90% accuracy.      
              


- **Sentiment Analysis and Summarization of Online Reviews**
	- Designed and built a machine learning model to extract the key positive and negative sentiments from the
IMDB reviews with respect to various aspects and provide a brief summary to the users.       
              


- **Hidden Markov model for Speech Recognition**
	- Built an isolated word recognition system using a Hidden Markov Model for each word and identifying the
word based on the highest model likelihood.        
           


- **Initially Labeled Learning in Non-Stationary Environments**
	- Developed an algorithm using an under-sampling approach combined with an ensemble approach to improve
the modelâ€™s performance in classification of non-stationary data.       
          


- **Unsupervised Framework to find spoken terms**
	- Developed an indexing module by using various clustering algorithms including the BIRCH clustering algorithm to enable searching a spoken query within large spoken audio database.

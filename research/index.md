My interests broadly lie in the fields of machine learning, natural language processing and computer vision. 
[Here](/research/courses/) is a list of all the courses I have taken, both during graduate and undergraduate studies.


- **Automatic Sense Prediction for Implicit Discourse Relations** (Spring 2018)  
 Under review at [EMNLP 2018](http://emnlp2018.org/).



- **Overcoming Language Variation in POS Tagging using Social Attention** (Fall 2017 - Spring 2018)  
 Working on building a novel attention-based neural network model that exploits social networks to make
POS tagging more robust to social language variation. [[arXiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07331) [[code]](https://github.com/bmurali1994/socialnets_postagging)  
 Published in Proceedings of [NAACL workshop on stylistic variation (2018)](https://sites.google.com/view/2ndstylisticvariation/home).



- **Deep Learning Models for Text Summarization** (Summer 2017)  
 SDE Intern, Amazon AI, Seattle, USA  
 Developed a recurrent neural network based hierarchical sequence-to-sequence model that uses attention
and pointer networks for both extractive and abstractive summarization in mxnet.




### Projects

- **Modeling Compositionality in Visual Question Answering VQA** (Fall 2017)  
 Exploring Relational and Dynamic Memory Networks to build VQA models that are more visually grounded
and have more reasoning ability.

- **Text to Image Synthesis using GANs** (Spring 2017)  
 Investigated various models using generative adversarial networks GANs to generate a sequence of images
based on the context extracted from a textual description.

- **Scene Recognition with Deep Learning** (Fall 2016)  
 Implemented AlexNet and VGG deep learning neural networks for the task of Instance Scene Recognition
on the 15 class scene dataset. Achieved upto 90% accuracy.

- **Encoding constraints into Community Detection algorithms** (Fall 2015 - Spring 2016)  
 Undergraduate Thesis, IIT Guwahati, India  
 Developed a constrained spectral community detection algorithm that can incorporate domain specific
degree-of-belief constraints about the clustering structure of the network to obtain better clusters.

- **Sentiment Analysis and Summarization of Online Reviews** (Spring 2016)  
 Designed and built a machine learning model to extract the key positive and negative sentiments from the
IMDB reviews with respect to various aspects and provide a brief summary to the users.


- **Hidden Markov model for Speech Recognition** (Fall 2015)  
 Built an isolated word recognition system using a Hidden Markov Model for each word and identifying the
word based on the highest model likelihood.


- **Initially Labeled Learning in Non-Stationary Environments** (Summer 2015)  
 Developed an algorithm using an under-sampling approach combined with an ensemble approach to improve
the modelâ€™s performance in classification of non-stationary data.

- **Unsupervised Framework to find spoken terms** (Summer 2014)  
 Developed an indexing module by using various clustering algorithms including the BIRCH clustering algorithm to enable searching a spoken query within large spoken audio database.
